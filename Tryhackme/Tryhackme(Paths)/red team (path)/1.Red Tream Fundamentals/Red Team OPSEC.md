OPSEC is a process to _identify_, _control_ and _protect_ any information related to the planning and execution of our activities.

The OPSEC process has five steps:

1. Identify critical information
2. Analyse threats
3. Analyse vulnerabilities
4. Assess risks
5. Apply appropriate countermeasures

<h3>Critical Information Identification</h3>

. Critical information includes any information that, once obtained by the blue team, would hinder or degrade the red team’s mission.


<h3>Threat Analysis</h3>

threat analysis aims to answer the following questions:

1. Who is the adversary?
2. What are the adversary’s goals?
3. What tactics, techniques, and procedures does the adversary use?
4. What critical information has the adversary obtained, if any?


We consider any adversary with the intent and capability to take actions that would prevent us from completing our operation as a threat:

```
threat = adversary + intent + capability
```

In other words, an adversary without the intent or capability does not pose a threat for our purposes.
