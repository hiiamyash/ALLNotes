This can include processes, file formats, COM (**C**omponent **O**bject **M**odel), task scheduling, I/O System, etc. This room will focus on abusing and exploiting processes and their components, DLLs (**D**ynamic **L**ink **L**ibraries), and the PE (**P**ortable **E**xecutable) format.


### Learning Objectives

- Understand how internal components are vulnerable
- Learn how to abuse and exploit Windows Internals vulnerabilities
- Understand mitigations and detections for the techniques
- Apply techniques learned to a real-world adversary case study
