### 🔐 What is **Encoding**?

**Encoding** is the process of converting data from one format into another, usually for compatibility, storage, or transmission.

- It is **not** meant to be secure or secret.
    
- Anyone who knows the **encoding format** can reverse (decode) it.
    
- Common use case: making binary data readable by systems that only accept text.
    

**Examples:**

- Base64 (e.g., used in email attachments, web data)
    
- URL encoding (`space` → `%20`)
    
- ASCII, UTF-8 (text representation of characters)

### 🔒 What is **Encryption**?

**Encryption** is the process of converting data into an unreadable format to **protect its confidentiality**.

- It requires a **key** to encrypt and decrypt.
    
- It is designed to **prevent unauthorized access**.
    
- Even if someone intercepts the encrypted data, they **cannot read** it without the correct key.
    

**Types of Encryption:**

- **Symmetric**: Same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES)
    
- **Asymmetric**: Public key encrypts, private key decrypts (e.g., RSA)
