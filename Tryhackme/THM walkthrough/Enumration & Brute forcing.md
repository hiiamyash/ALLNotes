Data Breach Information
 
Data from previous security breaches is a goldmine for attackers as it allows them to test whether compromised usernames and passwords are reused across different platforms.
    
Verbose errors can turn into a goldmine of information, providing insights such as:
 
Internal Paths:  
Like a map leading to hidden treasure, these reveal the file paths and directory structures of the application server which might contain configuration files or secret keys that aren't visible to a normal user.
 
Database Details:  
Offering a sneak peek into the database, these errors might spill secrets like table names and column details.
 
User Information:  
Sometimes, these errors can even hint at usernames or other personal data, providing clues that are crucial for further investigation
