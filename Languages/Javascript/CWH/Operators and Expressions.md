### **Comparision Opereator

![Pasted image 20250401224234](Pasted%20image%2020250401224234.png)

**the output will be fist one will be false and secound one is true

![Pasted image 20250401224458](Pasted%20image%2020250401224458.png)

 **in == it is comparing 6 with "6" and it is taking "6" as 6 value and giving true while in 6 line === is comparing 6 int value and "'6" as string so it is giving false

  
  ### Logical Operator

```js
let x =5
let y=6
console.log(x<y && x==5)
console.log(x<y || x==5)
consonle.log(!true)//this will return false
console.log(!false)//this will return true
