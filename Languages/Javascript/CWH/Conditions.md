```js
let a = prompt("Hey whats you age?");
a = Number.parseInt(a); // Converting the string to a number
if(a<0){
  alert("This is an invalid age");
}
```


difference between if else and switch statement is that 

in if else statement only one if else statement is going to execute rest all will be skipped

while in switch after executing the true one the rest of the statement also gets executed 


### Ternary operator
