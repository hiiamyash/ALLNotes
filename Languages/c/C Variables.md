In C, there are different **types** of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as `123` or `-123`
- `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as `19.99` or `-19.99`
- `char` - stores single characters, such as `'a'` or `'B'`. Characters are surrounded by **single quotes**

```
int myNum = 15;
```

You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:

```
// Declare a variable  
int myNum;  
  
// Assign a value to the variable  
myNum = 15;
```
