Lets suppose we want to do a task of addition 1+1 the execution unit take 1 from memory and then takes another 1 from memory add them and send it back to the memory this can take a lot of time and cpu power because the Ram memory is otside the cpu so from thinks to be faster small memeroies registers are built into the cpu which can percome the same task is less time
 
-------------Typer of registers

Resistor is made of 64 bits or 8 byte  
1 byte me 8bits hota hai  
1 character 1byte ka hota hai  
Lets soppose someone has a name for 9 character he cannot save that namme into register as it has only 8bytes so you have to save that into memory but you can save a 8 letter name into the registor

---------------RIP tells us which command is going to get executed by the cpu
 
-------------------Practical
