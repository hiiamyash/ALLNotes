This is the most important call becuause it tells the kernal what to do to write to read ect.  
But how do we tells the kernal what system call to perform ?  
We do this by .each system calls has a vaule so we store that specific value from thaat specific sysytem call in the rax resisitor then it gets exexcuted using syscall

System call value is stored in the rax and the values of the arguments of that system call is stored in the RDI,RSI,RDX resisters  
In this example it is exit system call of value 60 in hex 0x3c
