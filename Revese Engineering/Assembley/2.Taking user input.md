To get input instead of calling write we will call read system call

We are call read and giving arguments  
When user give input we don't know what he can give that'a why it can not be stored in the .data section so it has to be stored in the .bss section
 
Resb 100 means reserving 100byets

Now to print the user input you need the length size of the input which is retured after the read systemcall is finised now before the rax vaule changes we will stored that rax vaule onto an useless resister like rbx,rcx etc
