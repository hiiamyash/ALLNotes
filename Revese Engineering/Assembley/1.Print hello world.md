In this code we are trying to output hellow world  
The value in the rax instructs which sysytem call to make now look at the man page of the system call and see how many arguments we have to give to that system call that arguments vaule will be save din the reisiterms like rdi ,rsi,rdx etc  
In this specific exaple it is the write sysytem call the rdi vaule 1 tells us that we are outputing



![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173153-13.png|Exported image]]

Now in the rsi we have to moe the buffer which mens the thing that we want to write  
So in the data sectins we are going to make a variable and the db tells that it is in bytes that the 'hello world' output

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173159-14.png|Exported image]]

Third argument is the size count

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173201-15.png|Exported image]]

'Hello world' the size count is 11

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173204-16.png|Exported image]]  
![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173206-17.png|Exported image]]

Now we will conver the assembely code to machine code for the kernal to understand

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173210-18.png|Exported image]]

We cannot execute our object file because it is not liinked with nessesary libraries for it to run so we are goint to link aal the libreries using linker
 ![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173212-19.png|Exported image]]  
![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173214-20.png|Exported image]]  
![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173220-21.png|Exported image]]

It is giving an error segenmentation fault  
Meaning og the error==you told thee program to write the hello world but you diid'nt told him what to do after that you need to tell him to exit

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173222-22.png|Exported image]]  

Now in the program we have to make another syscall for exit

![[../../attchments/Exported image 20241213173225-23.png|Exported image]]

Exit only take one arguments
