coonversting opcodes into assemby iis called disassembly


It is possible to partially recreate the original high-level code from the disassembly. This
is known as decompiling

the CPU has to do several
instructions when adding numbers that have decimal values. If we are only interested in
39the result of this addition, we can skip over many of these instructions. Understanding
which instructions can be skipped comes with experience.
