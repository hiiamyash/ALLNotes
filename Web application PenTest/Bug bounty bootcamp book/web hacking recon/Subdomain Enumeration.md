Tools like Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, and Gobuster can enumerate subdomains  
We can combinne them to get the best results
 
Daniel Miessler’s SecLists at [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/) is a pretty extensive one. You can also use a wordlist generation tool like Commonspeak2 ([https://github.com/](https://github.com/) assetnote/commonspeak2/) to generate wordlists based on the  
most current internet data

Once you’ve found a good number of subdomains, you can discover more by identifying patterns. For example, if you find two subdomains of example .com named 1.example.com and 3.example.com, you can guess that 2.example.com is probably also a valid subdomain. A good tool for automating this process is Altdns ([https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns/](https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns/)), which discovers subdomains with names that are permutations of other subdomain names.
