Another source of information is the employees’ Google calendars. People’s work calendars often contain meeting notes, slides, and some times even login credentials. If an employee shares their calendars with the public by accident, you could gain access to these
 
Also check the company’s SlideShare or Pastebin accounts
 
Pastebin ([https://pastebin.com/](https://pastebin.com/)) is a website for pasting and storing text online for a short time. People use it to share text across machines or with others. Engineers sometimes use it to share source code or server logs with their colleagues
 
Go to Pastebin, search for the target’s organization name, and see what happens! You can also use automated tools like PasteHunter ([https://github.com/](https://github.com/) kevthehermit/PasteHunter/) to scan for publicly pasted data.
 
Using the Wayback Machine, you can find old endpoints, directory listings, forgotten subdomains, URLs, and files that are outdated but still in use. Tomnomnom’s tool Waybackurls ([https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls/)) can automatically extract end points and URLs from the Wayback Machine
