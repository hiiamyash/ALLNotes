GrayhatWarfare ([https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)) is an online search engine you can use to find publicly exposed S3 buckets (Figure 5-7). It allows you to search for a bucket by using a keyword. Supply keywords related to your target, such as the application, project, or organization name, to find relevant buckets

Finally, you can try to brute-force buckets by using keywords. Lazys3 ([https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3/](https://github.com/nahamsec/lazys3/)) is a tool that helps you do this. It relies on a wordlist to guess buckets that are permutations of common
 
Another good tool is Bucket Stream ([https://github.com/eth0izzle/](https://github.com/eth0izzle/) bucket-stream/)
