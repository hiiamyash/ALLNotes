If you’re hoping to find reflected and DOM XSS, look for user input in URL parameters, fragments, or pathnames that get displayed to the user. A good way to do this is to insert a custom string into each URL parameter and check whether it shows up in the returned page.
 
For example, I like to use the string "XSS_BY_VICKIE". Insert your custom string into every user-input opportunity you can find. Then, when you view the page in the browser, search the page’s source code for it
