first wee nead to understand what is an url and it's components


Of course! A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is essentially a web address used to locate a specific resource on the internet, like a webpage, image, or file. Think of it like a complete mailing address for a house, but for the internet.

Based on your image, let's break down the components of a URL.

### Anatomy of a URL

A URL can be deconstructed into several key parts, many of which are optional. The general structure is:

`Scheme://UserInfo@Host:Port/Path?Query#Fragment`

Let's use the second example from your image to identify each part: `http://admin:password@admin.tce.com:443/admin/admin.php?admin=true#settings`

---

#### 1. Scheme

This is the protocol that tells the browser how to access the resource. It's always the first part of the URL and is followed by `://`.

- **Common Schemes:** `http` (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), `https` (secure HTTP), `ftp` (File Transfer Protocol).
    
- **In the example:** The scheme is **`http`**.
    

---

#### 2. User Info (Optional)

This section contains a username and password for authentication, separated by a colon (`:`). It is rarely used in modern browsers for security reasons (sending passwords in plain text is a bad idea! 😟).

- **Format:** `username:password@`
    
- **In the example:** The user info is **`admin:password@`**.
    

---

#### 3. Host

The host specifies the server where the resource is located. It consists of a domain name (and optionally a subdomain).

- **Subdomain:** A prefix to the main domain, like `www` or `admin`. In the example, it's **`admin`**.
    
- **Domain:** The registered name of the website, like `google.com` or `tce.com`. In the example, it's **`tce.com`**.
    
- **In the example:** The full host is **`admin.tce.com`**.
    

---

#### 4. Port (Optional)

The port is a specific "gate" or endpoint on the server for the connection. Web browsers use default ports if one isn't specified:

- `80` for `http`
    
- `443` for `https`
    

Since these are the standards, the port number is usually omitted from the URL.

- **In the example:** The port is explicitly stated as **`443`**.
    

---

#### 5. Path

The path identifies the specific resource (e.g., a file or directory) on the server. It follows the host and starts with a forward slash (`/`).

- **In the example:** The path is **`/admin/admin.php`**, pointing to the `admin.php` file inside the `/admin/` directory.
    

---

#### 6. Query String (Optional)

The query string is used to pass data to the server. It starts with a question mark (`?`) and consists of key-value pairs. Multiple pairs are separated by an ampersand (`&`).

- **Format:** `?key1=value1&key2=value2`
    
- **In the example:** The query is **`?admin=true`**. Here, the key is `admin` and its value is `true`.
    

---

#### 7. Fragment (Optional)

Also known as an "anchor," the fragment is a reference to a specific section within the webpage. It begins with a hash (`#`) and is processed by the web browser, not the server. It's often used to jump directly to a part of a long page.

- **In the example:** The fragment is **`#settings`**. This would tell the browser to scroll to the element on the page with the ID `settings`.

just using the simple ssrf payload was giving this error
![Pasted image 20250810011045](Pasted%20image%2020250810011045.png)

that means it is cheacking for an specific string in the url

this gave acces to the admin panel and then used the below final payload to remove tthe user carloas
