i searched hello and then saw the http history in my burp suit
![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226154121.png]]
i see two imp in these search and search-results
![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226154226.png]]
this is the search-result

lets see the source code of the search func
![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226154652.png]]

we can see the search-results in scricpt tags and also an searchResults.js javascript
![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226154924.png]]
this is the js scritp and as soon as i see the eval fuction then there is an very high chance that the vuln is going to exit there

and eval funstion is adding + this.responceText

and eval fuction can execute another javacript inside them

![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226154226.png]]
now we will try to escape this json format and the execute our javascript
`"hello` we will use this
![[../../../attchments/Pasted image 20241226161232.png]]
our `"` got esaped using `\` and our `"` became the part for the string and we need to get out of the strring 

to do that we will escape the `\` using `\` and then it will read the `"` as `"` insted od a string

`\"};alert(1);//`
this payload worked we ended the first fuction using `;` and secound usong `;`
