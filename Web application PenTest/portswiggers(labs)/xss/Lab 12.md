i searched hello and then saw the http history in my burp suit
![Pasted image 20241226154121](Pasted%20image%2020241226154121.png)
i see two imp in these search and search-results
![Pasted image 20241226154226](Pasted%20image%2020241226154226.png)
this is the search-result

lets see the source code of the search func
![Pasted image 20241226154652](Pasted%20image%2020241226154652.png)

we can see the search-results in scricpt tags and also an searchResults.js javascript
![Pasted image 20241226154924](Pasted%20image%2020241226154924.png)
this is the js scritp and as soon as i see the eval fuction then there is an very high chance that the vuln is going to exit there

and eval funstion is adding + this.responceText

and eval fuction can execute another javacript inside them

![Pasted image 20241226154226](Pasted%20image%2020241226154226.png)
now we will try to escape this json format and the execute our javascript
`"hello` we will use this
![Pasted image 20241226161232](Pasted%20image%2020241226161232.png)
our `"` got esaped using `\` and our `"` became the part for the string and we need to get out of the strring 

to do that we will escape the `\` using `\` and then it will read the `"` as `"` insted od a string

`\"};alert(1);//`
this payload worked we ended the first fuction using `;` and secound usong `;`
