***sink***  refers to where the payload got stored for example inside the `<p>` tags
***source*** refers to where the payload is injecting for example the search parameter 

in reflected xss if you put hello iin the search box it sends an request to the server and gets aan response 
while in dom based xss it does'nt send any request too server every thing happens on the client side
