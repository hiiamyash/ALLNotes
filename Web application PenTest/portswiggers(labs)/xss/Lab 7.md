payloads taht i am thinking about 
`"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`

we will target the input tag and add autofocus and onfous to it

`a" onfocus="alert(1)" autofocus="alert(1)`

this worked

### another technique

fist select which tag you are targetiing in this case i was targeting the `<input>` tag
then i search the same tag in github xss paylaods
