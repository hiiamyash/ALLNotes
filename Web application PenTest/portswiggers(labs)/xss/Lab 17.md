This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets.

To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the `alert` function.

To assist with your exploit, you can assume that the simulated user will press the following key combinations:

- `ALT+SHIFT+X`
- `CTRL+ALT+X`
- `Alt+X`

Please note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.

at first i used this payload then i notices it was url encoding `"` and ` `

'onfocus=alert()autofocus='

we can see the single quotes are becomming doule quotes and it's givinh spaces automatically


now because the lab was about user clicking a key to get an xss we are going to use a payload with accesskey as an atribiute i found this paayload idea from portswiggers cheat sheet 
![Pasted image 20241229121149](Pasted%20image%2020241229121149.png)
```
'accesskey='X'onclick='alert(1)
```
this was the payload and it solved the lab
