This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the `alert` function.

helllo is getting reflected on three places

our main focus are going to be two places
script tag and img tag

`\';alert;//`

we can not bypass it

but we can close it using `</script>`  because it is allowed

`</script><script>alert(1)</script>`
