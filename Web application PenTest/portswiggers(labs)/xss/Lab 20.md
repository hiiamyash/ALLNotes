This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality.

To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the `alert` function when the comment author name is clicked.


i tried putting `javascript:alert(1)` directly into the website input box but it was checking for an url format so that was not possible

we have to get out of onclick using single quote

i tried `https:');alert(1)//`
![Pasted image 20241229183113](../../../attchments/Pasted%20image%2020241229183113.png)our single quote got escaped 
so i used another backspcae to break the escaping but it did't worked
`https:\');alert(1)//` but this didn't work because they were ading another backspace to escape the character

so i first tried url encoding encoding then i tried html encoding the single quote

html encoding working
`https:&#x27);alert(1)//`
this payload worked
