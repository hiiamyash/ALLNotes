## Dynamic Port Forwarding with SSH and SOCKS Tunneling


### Port Forwarding in Context

#### SSH Local Port Forwarding

**You ssh into an Victim Ubuntu Macine and The Victim is Running localhost:3306 Mysql and You(ATTACKER) Can Not Connect to the 3306 from Outside the Ubuntu machine So You Will Set SSh in an Way So if You Send Traffic to port 1234 on Our Machine then it will redirect that usiing ssh to port 3306 on the Victim machine and Recive Data from that 3306 to send itty back to 1234 port on the attacker machine**

```shell-session
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
`Listing on 1234 and Want to Forward Localhost:3306 then the target`

```shell-session
netstat -antp | grep 1234
```
`Verify the Connection of Port Forwarding`

```shell-session
nmap -v -sV -p1234 localhost
```
`Confirming Port Forward with Nmap`


```shell-session
ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 -L 8080:localhost:80 ubuntu@10.129.202.64
```
