#networking #basics

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication within a network segment. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and is used to ensure devices on the same network can distinguish one another.
   

Uses of MAC Address

1. Local Device Identification: Ensures unique identification within a local network, avoiding data collisions.
2. Network Filtering and Security: Routers or access points can use MAC filtering to allow or block specific devices based on their MAC addresses.
3. Data Transfer in LANs: Used by network switches to route data packets to the correct device within a LAN.
4. Device Tracking: Helps track devices connected to a network for inventory and monitoring.
